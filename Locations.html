<p class="heading">New York</p>
<div class="content">  <p>I want to try and put down all about my first, long overdue and hopefully not last trip to new york city, while it is all still fresh in my mind, the sounds of the honking cars, and just the general exuberance and vitality of the city that never sleeps. As someone said to me " everyone should see new york at least once". I echo this thought. It really is a place that has to be seen to be believed.
</br>
I could not think beyond the flight, would my 5000 euro chair that I had been waiting 18 months on make it in one piece, or would somebody tell me I couldn't fly unaccompanied, and refuse to let me board as BA had done last year.
</br> There was a sense of celebration as delta had just come out of debt, and were facing a brighter future. With the service and the food, I would travel with them again in a heartbeat! My wheelchair was very promptly brought up to me both in shannon and JFK. The shannon stopover was fine, as it meant I could have a drink and use the loo, US immigration was fine too.
</br>
This trip was really only possible because I managed to organise an assistant. I had long assumed that crossing the atlantic would be an event that would never materialise. I was only going for a few days (may 2-7) and knew that I wasn't even going to attempt to try and do/see everything new york has to offer. 
</br>Looking back we did a lot, but in a comfortable way ( although its easy for me to say this, as all I had to do was sit back and enjoy the ride, while on a couple of occasions, my poor assistant had to retire to the hotel room, while I went to loew's cinema whch was across the street from the hotel) .
</br>
We stayed at the Ramada New Yorker on 34th street, whose location just cannot be beat, with madison square gardens's, macy's, cinema, discount shops (heaven for me) all in the immediate vicinity. It must be in an old part of the city, as there are a number of 3 story buildings, which are very contrasted by their colossal neighbours. We were directly opposite a 24 hour adult shop and my favourite shop NY Man, which sells affordable cool men's clothes. I had died and gone to heaven!
</br>
I did'nt like macy's at all. I went on my own (which was probably part of the problem, as the place is so enormous), but quickly decided that I was'nt going to waste an evening in this tourist mecca.
</br> So I bought some socks and undies, and went back across to my cheap street where I bought a leather jacket. I am generally not attracted by name brands, and usually cheap & cheerful works just fine for me. But there's no point penny pinching on a long planned for holiday, that coupled with the strong euro, meant I got whatever I wanted and could justify.
</br>
We went to the empire state building, and the shop directly opposite it sold everything from pens to digital cameras. I could'nt justify buying the 10.1 digital camera with 2GB HD SD card for $300 (even though it was a great deal) I cannot stand pushy sales assistants, so I got some tshirts and a USB enabled dictaphone, and we were on our way to the top of the empire state.
</br>
To be honest, I was very pleasantly surprised by the good access around new york, but also by the priority attention given to chair users at popular tourist attractions. Nowhere was this more welcome than at the empire state, where the queue to get in was scary long! Not only tbe usual foreign tourists, but also a lot of high school students on school trips (our hotel was full of kids from texas).
</br>
Its very well organised, and the views from the observation deck are truly impressive. Through staff elevators we got to the top floor, but for a chair user its a waste of time as you won't see anything. 
</br>In the gift shop we secured tickets for the NY Waterway tour which is very good value at $27, and much better value than the helicopter ride for 7 minutes for $75, which would have meant I'd be no sooner in than out! The NY Waterway tour also provided a convenient free shuttle bus to take us to the harbour, and the bus stop was basically just outside the hotel's front door. The trip was 90 minutes, and the commentary was excellent, a mix of wit and fact. There was a high school choir from virginia there, and some of the teachers took great photo's of me with the impressive background.
</br>
As we passed the statie of liberty ( I had been warned not to waste a day taking the staten island ferry just to visit it, and it was good advice) and ellis island, my thoughts turned to all those immigrants, who endured that awful long journey in coffin ships, in search of a better future. I had had the same thought during the long flight over, if the flight was long enough..........
</br>The guide was one of the few people I tipped, especially as he had said at the end that " while not expected is always gratefully received". In that spirit, I have no problem tipping (the wad of notes in his fist...........if he makes that every 90 minutes!!!!!!!!), I just hate the feeling to be obliged to tip. So if the hotel doorman opened the door for me, was he simply doing his jo or subtly requesting money. The only time I was asked straightout for a tip, was from a skycap at JFK. On the whole, I think new yorkers get a bad rep, I found them to be genuinely good hearted people.
</br>
One day, we were making our way from st pat's cathedral ( be sure to see it) to the rockefeller centre, when we spotted too late, a big hole in the ground beside the pavement. Of course I nearly toppled out, but at least six people came over to check on me. Another evening on my own as I was making my way back to the hotel from loew's cinema, I had underestimated the width of the pedestrian crossing and had run out of breath halfway through (fat bastard that I am) but stil some nice guys (still suited and more than likely on their way home) came over and pushed me back to the hotel!
</br>
Times square really has to be seen to be believed. I can well understand tourists from new york coming to ireland, and thinking that our capital city is just a quaint little village. Thankfully I was with a new yorker who knew where to go. I have no sense of direction, and would not have been able to get off our hotel floor if left to my own devices. You have to be brave to drive in new york, there is no room for error, and you will be blown off the road for the smallest transgression! But the grid system of new york city is well planned, and people seem to get where they want.
</br>
One of the things almost at the top of my to do list was to see a film called The Cake Eaters at the tribeca film festival. One of the character's has friedreich''s ataxia. I knew I wouldn't make the thursday show, and they told me in loew's that as I had no ticket, and given that the film was popular, my best bet was to go early, get in line and hope for the best.
</br> When I got back to the hotel room late on thursday night, there was an email from mary caruso, one of the founders of the FA society in new york, telling me that she had two spare tickets. A missed opportunity! I emailed her back, asking her to try and pull some strings on my behalf. So near and yet so far! Her responce was that (the director) Mary Stuart Masterson could'nt even pull strings for herself on thursday.
</br>
So we took the subway, came out at ground zero, stopped for a few minutes at this haunting site. I was'nt going to be one of those stupid tourists getting photo's with their fake smiles against the railings. Its too ignorant and tacky! There was a hawker selling pictures in the vicinity, and I remember an american woman said "shame on you" to him. 
</br>After encountering a lift (same language but in the us lifts ate elevators, loos are restrooms, full sleeved is long sleeved, and I spent 10 minutes in Ny Man looking for a waistcoat, only to find out the americans call them vests) which was out of service, we took the road to tribeca in the heart of the financial district , an area which does'nt have the typical city atmosphere.
</br>
Anyhoo we were at the top of the line for spare tickets by 6.20pm, with the film not starting til 8. We finally get in and mary stuart masterson, scriptwriter/star jayce bartok and actor bruce dern are all there. Happy days !There was a Q &A session after the film, where they came up to me (I hadn't put all this effort in to get here, to go unnoticed at the back). Mission accomplished, we had planned to go to a club in chelsea, but an out of servcie elevator sign put paid to that, and we decided to go back to see time square at night which was just magical.
</br>
From day one, I was delighted with the wheelchair access in new york, curb cuts that came all the way down, lots of accessible buses and friendly, helpful people if all else failed. I had been braced for the worst. I was told new york is far behind other american cities, but for me it was very doable.I did not like the bathroom in our hotel room, where the wash basin area came up to my shoulder level, and rinsing after brushing could be hit and miss! Also the handrails and low toilet took some getting used to. An assistant, friend or family member is a must!
</br>
Sunday, the last day, was central park day. Oh before I forget, ALL TOURISTS NOTIFY YOUR BANK BEFORE GOING TO THE US!!!!!! I thought I had planned enough, I had put plenty of money into my credit card a/c, taken care of the mobile. I withdrew $900 in grand central station on saturday, but after that my problems started.
</br> I spent $443 in a shop near our hotel, duly handed over my card, but was told it had been refused.It took an hour before it was sorted out. But the next day it happened again. With not the price of a can of coke in my pocket, and being my last day, I had to phone back to ireland, to be told that I had triggered a security alert on my card. After a few routine security questions, restrictions were lifted , and all was well.
</br>
What a place John Lennon lived in! I was told new york is on the same longitude as rome, which accounts for the hot summers. I was also surprised that there were not more obese people around, given the food options and the portion sizes, but I was told that new yorkers walk it off, plus they always have central park. We saw the fabulous bryant park and metropolitan museum (even though we did'nt have time to go in).
</br> There was a huge israeli pride parade, and my assistant had to tear me away from the hardline stand which sold tshirts saying "Not one Inch" around a picture of an upturned fist (no prizes for guessing what that referred to). After that it was off to the hotel to pack. We passed the queue's for the broadway musical "The Color Purple" which I would dearly love to have seen, but hey, I guess that just means I'll have to come back.......... </p></div>



<p class="heading">Egypt</p>
<div class="content">
  <p>When you're in a wheelchair especially with a progressive illness, your world, what you can do, and the options open to you, become very limited. So, its truly fantastic to step out of your routine and discover there are tour possibilities out there that can help expand your realm of possilities, which inevitably helps you in numerous ways. 
    </br>
    Even though I must have pulled a muscle in my right arm (through breaking a fall??), I just have to write about my amazing week in Egypt thanks to a wonderful tour group that I found through the net (god bless it, gotta love it) namely Enjoy Tours. (This company now seem to be no more sunday 11/5/08) My digital camera paid for itself several times over, as the pictures came out great. To actually behold these monuments in the flesh, and be transported back in time by the history which they effortlessly possess, was truly humbling. I was only there for a week, but feel like I could easily write a book. My senses were constantly bombarded, every sight and smell was new and indelible.
  </br>
   All the fears I had of going to egypt in spite of my increasingly disabled body, the obvious inaccessibility, the heat-would I get sunstroke, the food, getting there-would the airline people lose my chair, and what if I needed the loo during the flight, thankfully proved groundless. Even though it took a while to organise the flights, I presumed it was going to be one long continuous flight and subsequently requested a seat at the back beside the loo as I had done years befoe on my long haul flight to johannesburg. This was the worst thing I could have said, as it set off all of air france' alarm bells. The dublin-paris flight was only by a small cityjet, and it would have been impossible to even access them. The fact that the flight getting there were broken into 2, suited me fine.
 </br>
    After a 1 1/2 hour flight to paris, we had to change planes and I could use the loo. The one thing I would always make a point of doing in future,is to make sure that there is a gap of at least one hour between flights. I had no idea paris airport was so huge, and I only just made the connecting flight ( I missed the connection on the return trip, as because wheelchair passengers are the last off the flight, there was only a 1/2 hour window and there was no way I was gonna make it, but I did'nt mind as it gave me 3 hours to get something to eat, use the loo, and make some phonecalls).
  </br>
   A helpful tip is to ensure your luggage is tagged to go straight through to your final destination, so you dont have to collect anything at the interim stop, and the plane to your final destination will not take off without you (even if you are late) as long as your luggage is onboard.
 </br>
    I had just gotten a new wheelchair the week before the flight (after a year's wait) It is ergonomically designed to assist your   posture, and keep you more upright. It has been worth the wait, but knowing the reputation of airline baggage handlers, I was too afraid to bring it with me.I reverted to my old chair (terrible slouched posture with no armrests) and my boss in work made me wooden armrests, to stop me falling out ( I broke the first one getting off the loo at dublin airport going out, and a little boy helping me down off a step at the pyramids broke the second, but it was the thought that counts, and I have had the uncanny ability since childhood of being able to break anything not made of steel, I was'nt very popular with my siblings at christmas, but I digress).
  </br>
  The 4 1/2 hour cairo flight from paris was'nt bad either. It always makes the flight go better when you're seated beside nice people, and I had a good chat with a woman from mexico and an elderly egyptian man. I just don't know how people pass the time on such long flights as to austalia. I think a flight that long would be absolutely lethal to me. When I arrived in cairo, I was impressed by the airport, I think I must have been expecting some third world imitation airport ramshackle.
  </br> I was amazed looking around me at the faces of egyptians who could very easily have passed for spanish or italian. The warm, dry air was very welcome as the previous weeks in ireland had been the usual rain, rain and more rain . Even though, it was now nearly 11pm, my enjoy tours team and private van ( the only way to travel) were waiting to help me through customs and onto le meridien pyramids 5 star hotel.
</br>
  The view from this hotel has to be seen to be believed. It was just simply staggering. I've never stayed in such luxury before but for $70 per night, you'd be crazy not to spoil yourself. You want to see inside the hotel, I found myself taking video of the huge lobby adorned with a colossal chandelier. It was like something out of dynasty! When I arrived at the hotel after a crazy 45 minute drive through the chaotic streets of cairo, I met the founder and owner of enjoy tours, a 33 year old medical doctor, who has one of these personalities that is just magnetic, and you have no qualms about believing and putting your trust in him. He told me that he wanted me to have an excellent week.
</br>
I dont know what type of person they were expecting. For the past 2 months I had been in almost daily contact with them through email. Arriving saturday may 18th until sunday may 28th. Those dates were engraved in my memory and of course I'd sent them the flight no's and times.Imagine the state I was in when I got an email from them on thursday 16th, saying they were ready to pick me up TOMORROW!! I was frantic, sent them tons of email, also told them I'd take legal action if there was no one there to meet me after I'd gone all that way. Unfortunately I am the sort of person who acts first, and thinks about the reasons behind it later. It was only a translation problem, and was later resolved with a phonecall on friday..
</br>
Sunday was spent with a morning trip to the pyramids. I don't know why but during the daytime they just did'nt live up to expectations, I guess when you build something up in your head, the reality always fails to live up. The sound & light show at night, where the pyramids and sphyinx are illuminated together with a narrated history of their coming into being, was breathtaking. As would happen so many times to me during the week, I found it hard to believe that this was actually my reality, that here I was on a raised platform having a diet coke, in front of these awe inspiring creations. 
</br>I had paid extra to bring my camera and camcorder in, but I eventually put them down to let my own eyes do the recording job.
</br>
That first day was also spent with a visit to funky bros cotton shop where I splurged on the 100% cotton goods buying 2 luxurious huge bath towels, tshirts,socks, a hand embroidered waistcoat and 3 fantastic full sleeved tops (with no buttons which is a definate plus for me). We went to a papyrus shop and bazaar. I don't like pushy salespeople, whose nice smiling demeanour and almost overbearing "assistance" change when it becomes obvious that you are not going to seriously spend. 
</br>I dont like tacky tourist crap, so I'm not interested in mini pyramids or anything like that. I like practical presents, so I got bags and jewellary boxes made from camel skin. I think the egyptian custom of giving you some sort of beverage upon entry to the shop, has more to do with keeping you inside the shop, rather than just a frienly act, but its still nice.

Next stop was to an egptian natural essence/oil shop where after a lengthy diatribe about the goodness and usefullness of pure egyptian oils, I was parted with $160 for four 6oz bottles, and an oil burner thrown in for good measure to help seal the deal. I think a good rule of thumb is if you smell a rat head for the door! 
</br>Boy, was I pissed when later in the week in aswan I could have bought 6 20 oz bottles for$240 which was infinately better value. Well, live and learn, but what really annoyed me was the shop manager seemed to definately know one of my guides, and later a vendor of oils in my hotel in cairo told me that what normally happens, is for the tour guide to bring the gullible tourist into the shop, and in return they get a share of the transaction. It makes sense now why they kept on telling me that I was getting a great deal. This was to happen to me twice (methinks) during the week.
</br>
As the man told me in our hotel, "hey, its business here".I regret pissing that money away, especially as you do see the abject poverty, the gangs of hardened streetchildren who lurk around, and all the people doing whatever it takes to eek out a living. (update 16/8/06: Now I think I got a good deal (still not as good as aswan though)as I have seen for myself how these oils work. 
</br>If you add a tiny amount of them to your aromatherapy oils, you can see the whole bottle go crazy, and I have stopped adding the orange blossom oil to water for diffusion purposes, as even 3 drops is too powerful, and the well of water with the egyptian oils resembles a bubbling cauldron and eventually catches fire. So, yes, they are super powerful, and at this rate will last me for a very long time).
</br>
Had a great nights sleep in my huge room in le meridien pyramids in cairo, where the bed was just at chair level,. making for an easy transfer. Sometimes the beds in hotels tend to be too high, and it was'nt so bad when I had more strength in my legs and could sort of stand, but now I just cannot do any sort of high jump into bed, and I dont like being too high, cause if I fall out of bed its almost impossible to get back and reception would be getting a hasty call.
</br>
The best money I spent by far, was on my assistant Khaled. Without him it would not have been a carefree week, but rather a draining obstacle. The fact that he had little or no english was a problem. I found myself raising my voice when I would ask, for the umpteenth time, for him to get the suncream, and instead he would bring me toothpaste ! For stuff like charging up my camcorder or phone, and for help dressing and pushing he was just invaluable! As far as egypt goes, unless you are in perfect shape (and its still going to be tough and demanding), you need an assistant. My assistant only cost $240 for 6 days which was rediculously cheap.
</br>
Monday morning was an early start, being up and on the road (via private van) to cairo airport to get a domesic flight to luxor for the nile cruise. I've never been on a ship before, and had visions of being seasick pretty soon. I could not have been more wrong. It was the most opulent luxurious stay on what I can only describe as a floating palace.
</br>
In luxor, I was picked up by van, with a young tour guide,driver another helper and khaled (who had endured a very long train journey from cairo) It was great having a personal tour guide and we drove to the valley of the kings. King Tuts tomb was not possible to get into and my usual plan b of giving someone my camcorder was scupered, as they do not allow video camera's beyond a certain point. Thankfully this was to be the only place I could not enter (just a pity it happened to be the first stop) and I saw all of the boy king's stuff back in the egyptian museum in cairo.
</br>
The sun was beating down, and stupidly I had no hat with me, it was back in the van. But I had to retrieve it as I could feel sunstoke coming on. English tourists came up to me in Luxor, putting sunspray on me. I am rediculously white, and even though I love the sun, just cannot afford to overdo it.
</br> I had promised myself to be ultra cautious with regards to my health, and I was well stocked up with factor 50 sunscreen, anti everything, hats, bottled water,disinfectants etc. For a week's trip,time is of the essence, and even if you were unwell and in the loo for a day, your trip would be ruined.
</br>
I had lunch recently with a good friend, who is married to an iranian, and she laughed when I told her of the supposed fear of the unhygienic egyptians. She said that they think that we westerners are incredibly dirty, after all moslems clean themselves scrupulously before praying, and they seem to do an awful lot of praying. I imagine it would be hard to be a non muslim, as mosques and noisy immans are everywhere.
</br>
I got a lot of very useful tips from one of the best unbiased travel sites on the net. Most of the health fears were easily avoided, bottled water with a tight sealed cap ( so you knew it hadn't been tampered with) was everywhere, and as regards food in the ship and hotel, we were eating like kings. In fact on the last full day in aswan, they asked me whether I wanted to eat in the hotel or in a local restaurant. I happily chose the local and had a feast for 9 euro! In fact its so cheap you treat everyone or leave a big tip ( I have a story about my experiences with tipping but will relay it later).
</br>
Actually, I'll relay it now lest I forget. In ireland, it is not the custom to tip ANYONE. However in egypt, it is the custom to tip EVERYONE. It was'nt a problem for me to tip the drivers and assistants as I had seen the sweat rolling off, as they got me around these ancient temples and ship gangways.
</br>
One tour guide asked me why I needed to get more money from the bank, when I had been at another one the day before. I was tipping 20-45 euro's to many ( a lot in a country where teachers get 25 euro a week), and I was always quickly short. Indeed Dr Mohammad Gamal, the young visionary founder of enjoy tours told me, that they should have given tipping guidelines for tourists from ireland and britain, as he had sometimes received annoyed reports that sometimes the guides received nothing from said tourists.
</br>
The profuse thanks, and looks of delight were thanks enough, except for one person who never even acknowledged it, and therein lies my problem with tipping. For me tipping is an act of appreciation, not a forced obligation, regardless of whether you are happy with the service or not.
</br>
As spectacular as the valley of the kings and temples of karnak and luxor are, after a while, I'm sorry, but they all look the same. At times I would have problems registering the fact that this was my reality, that I was actually beholding these creations whose majesty had been preserved by the sands for so long, and whose image I had always assumed, for me at least, would never be witnessed in person.
</br>
Later on the ship, we had the captain's formal welcome cocktail party where we all dressed up in our glad rags.The ship had 68 passengers, all from spain and a few from south america, a mother & daughter from nottingham, 2 from portugal and yours truly. The owner of the boat's wife was spanish and that was the lingua franca for sure. The 5 of us quickly gelled. It was great for me as my assistant had no english, so there would be plenty of awkward silences.One evening I was up on the sun deck looking at the fabulous lush greenery by the nile as we gracefully and admiringly sailed down it. Little wonder then that over 90% of egyptians still live along the course of the nile. Beyond its immediate, life giving banks, lies harsh unremmitting desert.
</br>
Anyways, there I was admiring the views when a young woman said "hola" to me. I did my pigeon spanish responce, but it turned out she had been to ireland, and had excellent english. Meeting Blanca was very special for me as it turns out she now works for an organization in cairo that helps the street children. I had brought so many t shirts, presents and sweets, but I did'nt see much overt signs of hardship and povety in cairo ( I guess the tourist police were doing their job) Blanca confirmed all the horror stories I had heard, and then some!
</br>
She spoke especially of the plight of many of the girls, imagine if you are a raped, pregnant girl in a strict moslem country? Whatever chance boys have, girls have none! Blanca said she has seen many girls with slashes on their faces, the result of being part of a gender, that is still seen as disposable and inherently inferior.
</br>
I personally thought that the climate had changed, looking around cairo, you see women, some veiled some not, and those that are covered, are very stylishly covered,with plenty of colour and very little dark drab floorlength outfits. But I was assured that the reality had remained depressingly unchanged. I freely admit that I have lots of clothes and stuff that I have either never worn or worn only once. It was with great pleasure that on the last night in cairo, I filled a huge hamper bag with all the stuff I had brought, and even soaps and shampoos(I have a terrible habit of taking all the miniature shampoos etc that you get in hotels).

I gave them to blanca, as she said its one less thing that the street children have to buy. I regret that she did not make an announcement on the cruise, explaining what she does, and inviting everyone to donate stuff. We all have so much of everything, she would be doing us the favour by relieving us of them, and making room in our suitcases for all the stuff we would buy in egypt. But she did'nt, I think because she was on a break with her mother and did'nt feel it was appropriate.
</br>
There is a good shot of me having just woken up staring out the window as we cruise down the nile. The days were a mixture of lazing around up on the sundeck, having a massage, texting back to rainy ireland (and making them jealous), and then when we docked, the van and tour guide would be waiting for me (yes it was that organized), and then when were tired from sightseeing, back to our ship, where there was some entertainment every night from bellydancing to nubian shows.
</br>
It was real 5 star luxury all the way, to the point where I sometimes felt guilty living such a high life in the midst of such poverty.When we docked in Edfu, I had a close encounter with a very shady stallowner, where I was saved thanks only to the fact that his credit card machine was on the blink. I had a bad vibe as soon as we went into his stall. "You like this?" , straight into a black bag without waiting for a responce,again "you like this?", eventually he had seven or eight items in bags. I told him there was no point putting them into bags, until I was happy with the agreed price. He then took out his calculator and came back with a "special" price of 220 euro for everything.
</br>
I settled on 3 tops for 60 euro and he was going to "let"me have 2 handmade tablecloth sets (which he would'nt take out of their bags) for another 50 euro. His credit card machine was broken, and we were pushed for time, so he let me take the goods and said I could give the 110 euro to my tour guide, who would see him the following week.
</br>
Back in my room on the ship, I wanted to have another look at what I had bought. I don't drink or smoke, and don't mind spending money, as long as I have something to show for it. One of the fantastic white embroidered tops was not there, and in its place was a folded sheet of cotton. I was'nt impressed and began to see that man's true colours.
</br>

Immediately I thought about the exspensive handmade tablecloths. I asked khaled to spread one out over the bed, and I understood why he had been reluctant to let me see them in his stall. Plain is an understatement! I would not pay 50 euro for those two ANYWHERE. Back on the ship, there followed a quick chat with the guys at the reception desk, who served as translators also for a bemused khaled, who was probably wondering why I was going red in the face. I showed them the tablecloths, and they told me that these plain, poor quality ones are generally used in egypt in funeral houses to put the dead body on display with.
</br>
I decided to keep the two tops, leaving 30 euro for the stallowner, a 30 euro tip for the tour guide and a bag with the two tablecloths for the guide to take back. I dont know if the guide was in on the scam, as he kept telling me at the time that I was getting a great bargain, but the scam backfired. The day before I left cairo, they received an angry call from the tour guide, but when I showed them the 2 tops, they knew he had been trying to scam me. All I can say, is that if the transaction had gone through on my credit card, it would have been very annoying. I think I had a very lucky escape.
</br>
That evening, my spirits were lifted when we had a fancy dress party, where all the passengers had to dress up in egyptian outfits It was a fantastic night, and so funny to see! The spanish certainly know how to party ! The next morning the boat stopped briefly in front of the temple of komombo. Its a great pity that my video cassette of this did'nt make it. The views were spectacular, with the ship docked right in front of the temple.
</br>
The street hawkers are so persistant, and I had to laugh as I heard one elderly spanish woman try to explain, in a mixture of spanish and english, that she had already bought the said souvenir before. Then it was onto aswan, and it looked so fantastic. It is big and full of impressive buildings,and I could'nt wait to have a closer look, but I was in for a shock...........
</br>
Everyone was leaving the boat, and heading off with their respective tour guides, but there was no sign of anyone for me. I knew there was something wrong,. as everything had run like clockwork the whole cruise, I could always be certain that my tour team would be ready and waiting for me in the lobby. It turned out that I did have the afternoon free but the tour guide that morning had forgotten to tell me.
</br>
Had I have been told in advance of the free afternoon, it would have saved me a fit, thinking that I had saved and paid to do nothing. From the very beginning, I knew it was going to be an intensive week, but had vowed to push myself. I wouldn't go all that way to do nothing more than sunbathe. Some people like to do that, and see little beyond the artificial confines of their hotel, but its not for me. Anyway, the impromptu free afternoon was filled by sunbathing, chats and massage.
</br>
I could not wait to get out in Aswan, as it looked so impressive from the boat, and lucky for me the team were ready to roll by the evening. First e went to the unfinished obelisk, and to see the actual stone quarries, where all those elaborate and huge pieces were conceived, and then brought to the nearby nile to be transported to cairo etc.I gave the camcorder to khaled and could see it in its entiriety later. Then it was on to see the mighty aswan dam, which was a momentous undertaking, as it had to divert the course of the mighty nile, in order to harnesss electricity for the major cities of egypt.
</br>
By this stage I was exhausted, all the lack of sleep, and forcing myself onwards had caught up with me. The poor tour guide thought he had done or said something wrong, as it was patently obvious that I couldn't give a crap about the history of the dam (at that time), but he was ok when I told that the reason I was yawning and looked totally disinterested was because I hadn't slept in two nights straight.
</br>
We decided to switch gears a little, and go to a nearby nubian village. The nubian people are a distinct ethnic minority in egypt (much darker looking) whose ancient lands happened to be needed in order to build the dam. So they had to be moved out of the dam path, and you can still see saved temples that are now surrounded by water. So for $30 we got a welcome drink in the village, and handpicked henna tattoos. They look fine on your upper arm, but I made the classic mistake of having one on my hand (which of course smudged). I bought some fabulous walking sticks, designed to look like about-to-strike cobra's, and a woven bag. The village was so tranquil, with resting camals taking a breather from the punishing sun.
</br>
To see the felucca's sail around aswan port was beautiful, but to go shopping in the local markets was fantastic. My assistants did the dealing for me ( after the fiasco in edfu,they knew the vendors might easily fool a wide eyed tourist, but not a fellow egptian) and I got some great bargains, especially shoes. Shoes with convenient velcrobe that I wear everyday,and only cost 8 euro were a particularly good buy!
</br>
Starving (and refusing to eat out when I had paid good money for the restauraunt on the boat) I made it back, just in time for the evening buffet. Aswan was the last stop on the cruise, and the next morning we went to the airport in Aswan for a flight to cairo
</br>
Met up with Pilar from Cadiz, where in espeenglish we chatted, and admired each other's elaborate henna tattoos. I remember her saying that she thought I was indiana jones, and at least for that extraordinary week, I guess I was.
</br>
The flight back to cairo was very early ( at 6.30am), and I was looking forward to an onboard snooze. This was not meant to be, as a large group of mostly white south africans got on, including one mouthpiece who just loved the sound of his own voice. I felt so sorry for the crew, as they tried to get the asshole to put on his belt, and when one of his own group turned around and told him to shut his mouth, an onboard fight nearly ensued. So I didn't have a peaceful flight, but at least the one good thing is that were back in cairo early.
</br>
We made our way to the egyptian museum, where I got to finally see the contents of the tomb of tutankhamen, whose tomb I could not see in the valley of the kings. It is VERY impressive. Apparently it only took three months after the death of a pharoah to produce all of the trappings of his wealth and prestige, which would accompany him on his eternal journey.
</br>
After lunch ( I manage very well insulin wise, my body lets me know whether I'm too high or whatever, which is just as well as the portions are HUGE for the money)we embarked on the place which I really wanted to visit in cairo, the famous Khan al khalili market. This place is steeped in history, being referenced by columbus as a place where east meets west. My eyes were like saucers as I was mesmerised by the colours, smells, throngs of people,acres of shops..........I''d died and gone to heaven!
</br>
Again, watch out for those vendors! I saw a fantastic lamp, which I set my heart on,but he wouldn't go less than 90 euro (which he claimed was his cost price). I eventually bought an exact replica down the street for half the price. I got great full sleeved tops for 5 euro. It is a shoppers paradise, and it would be easy to spend a full day there browsing. One thing I found interesting is that you don't see beggars. The people there have a tangible sense of esteem and dignity(or it could be down to the tourist police who are everywhere).
</br>
Went to the sound & light show in english, and by the time it was over, it seemed to finish off superly what had been an amazing few days. The hotel is just opposite the pyramids, and I was told I would have to be up for 5am, so I went for a farewell meal and drink at the hotel's nubian restaurant. They were probably dying for me to sling my hook, but I just wanted to leisurely absorb my last few hours, and after that I did go to bed (fully clothed)with the t.v on. The next morning I was on an early flight to paris,and then to dublin. I was nearly comatose and still was going in to work the next day. After a week like that, I almost felt I could do with another holiday to recuperate

I don't think I will make a trip like this again.The world is too big, and so much else to see,to be going back to the same places. Also, I have a week booked in rome for next may, and I have a 3 hour direct flight booked with aer lingus. Its just too much hassle and headache for me to be travelling to these places. Even though the timelesss tour was reasonable, when you have to pay for assisstance, the price soon skyrockets. Eventually, you'll end up spending money that could have been spent on online casino games, shopping, or other stuff. I dropped lots of big tips (like 40/100/200 euro) and still they wanted more. I gave my assistant 200 euro on the last day, paid for a saree for his wife, but still I got an email yesterday asking for more help to publicise his company, as he is trying to marry off a daughter, and needs to raise a big dowry. I don't fucking think so! That human greediness, which no disability or wheelchair will protect you from, has left a very bitter taste in my mouth, especially now as I am home. There should be guidelines given from your tour company, when it comes to tipping. Often I felt like a lamb to the slaughter, oh well, the important thing is that the good memories far outweigh the bad. Maybe I should just chalk these up as expensive travel tips. Its hard knowing that you have to scrimp and save, because you know your holiday is going to cost as much as a family of four, when you factor in assistance, but its worth it to escape your routine ultimately!
</br>
Here's the original report:
</br>
Is a trip to india possible for someone with an increasingly physically disabled body? Well, with Timeless Excursions, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding yes! I am just back from an amazing, and memory filled 13 days, and even though it feels strange to now be talking about these fresh memories in the past tense, it is my hope that this account will help someone else.
</br>
I have heard india described as beautiful ugly india. How could someplace be both beautiful and ugly? But this description suits india perfectly. I had been planning this trip since january, indeed I am exhausted now that its all over. When you have extra needs, be prepared to put in the time to make all those phone calls, and send those faxes. Although, despite all my diligent efforts and assurances by klm that they knew my physical situation, and were indeed expecting me, both gong to and coming back from delhi, this did not seem to be the case. So, I think the moral of the story, is to expect the unexpected, and assumee that a certain amount of lip service will be paid.
</br>
I didn't know that you needed a visa for india. It must have to do with security concerns,so even though I was reluctant to send off my passport through the post (for fear of identity theft), I was delighted when the visa was promptly returned in 5 working days (you have to pay 50 euro).Despite my best efforts, the klm crew in amsterdam, seemed to have no clue that I was travelling unaccompanied. What saved my bacon, (especially on the return leg) was to have a medical cert in my bum bag.
</br>
We had been at dublin airport at 3am , and it turned out to be a very wise move, as we had just finished checking in when a busload of dutch tourists arrived ready to go home. I will definately go back to amsterdam again. The klm staff were so lovely. And then after another long four hours we were on the final haul to Delhi. Its impossible to completely keep boredom at bay on a long flight. You can sleep a bit, look at the in-flight movie, even try to read, but basically you're just trying to put in the hours. We arrived in Delhi at 10.50pm. I was instantly very impressed with Delhi airport, I had been expecting a vintage, overcrowded, third world imitation of an airport, but it was quite plush and well designed.
</br>
The people from Timeless were waiting for me with placards. My assistant was there along with a driver and the tour company reps. We then made our way to the Oberoi Maidens Hotel, which is situated in old Delhi. As I was to learn the next day, Delhi can be divided into pre and post colonization .What was called New Delhi is full of British architecture, including many great monuments,and the largest parlaiment buildings in the world. Old Delhi is another story entirely. The hotel, as beautiful as it was, is slap bang in the middle of Old Delhi, and my first night on the way to the hotel, I saw many people sleeping on crates or even on the bare concrete. This was my first encounter with third world India at its depressing worst .
</br>
I had paid extra to have the one assistant with me throughout the trip. This proved to be a very wise choice. It would have been cheaper for me to have different assistants, but would have been more difficult, in that you would'nt have had the time to form a relationship. With the one assistant over time, he learned how to customise and gear his services especially for me. Its something I often think, that the next most important question after seeing someone in a wheelchair, is to identify just why they are in the wheelchair. We are all so different, and have entirely different needs and wants .At the beginning he tried to feed me, which explains the above point. Later, as the trip wore on, we really had developed a professional relationship. He knew when to assisst, and when to back off. Also he was great, as after time went by, he would tell me if I was spending too much money on tourist junkets, and as a result I managed to avoid most of the typical tourist pitfalls.
</br>
However on the first day in Delhi we were brought to a government run shop called Saga, where I grossly overspent, and indeed spent the rest of the holiday lamenting it. The Indian custom of giving you a welcome drink, has more to do with keeping you within the confines of the shop, rather than simple hospitality. Everything in this shop was rediculously expensive, and my assistant later told me that he had bitten his lip, as he knew that I was being fleeced, but he couldn't say anything, as he still was just getting to know me. After all the money I spent in this shop, the manager only gave me a free bag, which on reflection was extremely insulting, and in every other part of India I got much nicer free gifts, with purchases that cost me an awful lot less money. I am putting this down, as i feel that tourists need to be conscious of the fact, that they are in the middle of the third world, and big money can be spent an awful lot better. If I had my time over again, I would have by-passed this shop, and happily given my money away. It is very upsetting to stop the car and be surrounded by beggars and street hawkers.
</br>
It was a private tour I had my own Toyota Ortiz, driver and assistant, and the whole stay in India I was treated like a king. We saw all the sights Delhi has to offer, including the old markets where people sell footwear that has been just robbed from Muslim Mosque's, and the gory sight of live chickens in cages, just waitnig to be selected and butchered. Also on the first day, as you cannot get Rupees outside India, it meant due to the lateness of my arrival the night before that I was absoutley penniless save my credit card. We eventually managed to track down an ATM machine later in the evening, but until then it was plastic. It was almost like being on a different planet, nothing can prepare you for the sight of cows on the street. Unfortunately cows in many respects seem to have an easier life than humans, many of whom we saw sleeping rough under bridges and whom my Delhi tour guide dismissed as dirty unhygenic people, rather than as his brother and sister Indians. Yes,, the class system is still alive and well!
</br>
I had chosen instead of short domestic flights, to have longer drives through the countryside. This had two purposes, one obviously being to save money, but the other was to see the real India and people going about their normal business. Delhi is surely changing, there are new factories going up everywhere, and there are obviously a lot of people with money. There were so many new and big cars on the road. We had begun our five hour trip to Jaipur, which was one of the highlights of the entire visit. The majectic Palace of the Winds, has to be seen to be believed. We were also fortunate to arrive there on the birthday of Lord Krishna, so there was a festival atmosphere. Just goes to show that you can only plan so much, I had made a nuisance of myself, double and triple checking that my video camera was on all the right settings. Its the coulours and sounds of India that you want to try and capture, but my camcorder broke down the very first day, and only started recording in black and white. I was very upset but luckily in the middle of all the chaos of Jaipur we found a little camcorder repair shop and it turned out it was only a chip in my LCD screen that was gone so for 60 euros i had my camcorder back working in perfect colour. The opulance of the lives led by the Maharajah's is a little too decadent. I know now they are trying to have a social conscience and have donated a lot of their properties to the Indian government, but especially in times past they led lives of sheer decadent luxury seemingly unaware, or uninterested in the plight of the people all around them.
</br>
The first day or two had gone so well health wise that I began to let my guard down, feeling comfortable enough to even gargle in the morning after brushing my teeth with tap water. However on the third day I felt a little tummy upset after this myself and my assistant decided that in future we would use only mineral water for this purpose. I had to be very strick health wise, as my schedule was so intensive , that even one sick day would have messed up the entire tour. When I heard my assistant tell the tour guide that if I fell sick that the entire tour would be cancelled it certainly redoubled my efforts to look after myself. It would be a terrible shame to go all that way , spend so much money and so much time planning, to miss out on all India has to offer, because you are either sick in bed or on the toilet. So I was careful to have lots of naps( even though I found it impossible to sleep soundly during the night) and wear my big sun-hat which I bought in Jaipur, and which I credit with being one of the main reasons why I stayed healthy. Sunstroke I'm sure is one of the major reasons why tourists fall down health wise. I never have been a fan of very spicy food, but I decided that I was not going to go all that way, and eat my burgers and chips. So we settled on some mild spicy Indian dishes especially mutton biryani, which I found myself ordering every day, terrible creature of habit that I am.
</br>
I have five hours of video which I look forward to editing and putting on You Tube. The colours of the sari's the smells of the incense and sandalwood are just mesmerising, which no guidebook can prepare you for. I cleverely had brought a lot of toys. In Jaipur the car was stopped temporarily in the middle of the chaotic street when a little beggar boy came up to the car , tapped on the window, put his fingers to his mouth, in the typical begging fashion. I 'd been told not to give children money, as it would go into the pockets of their minders so instead we had the card loaded up with toys, fruit and chocolate. I gave this boy a little ball that I bought out in Blanchardstown with Disney World characters on it, and he absoutley broke my heart because we came across him the next day with the ball jealously tucked tightly under his arm. I dont think deeds like this are at all heroic, we are all part of a big global family and it is not divinely ordained that tourists to this country can go around spending so much money on souveneirs that in reality might soon be relegated to a drawer when there are children etching out an existance. This boy could not have been more than six. Shortly after this I decided to be a lot more careful about the money I spent and try not to be so immune to the sights all around me. Indeed when we arrived in Agra and went to one big factory where they sold marble everything at astronomical prices. The salesperson showed me his shipping book with a lot of Irish customers who had spent many thousand of euro on marble goods which were going to be shipped back to Ireland. For a little trinket box he wanted $900, I just thought to myself that its really revolting to indulge yourself to thiss extent when there are children fighting over an apple outside.
</br>
This whole trip had been my own birthday present to myself, and to spend my thirty third bithday at the Taj Mahal was the best present ever. It was such a serene place, and the guide had told me that of the seven wonders of the world , the Taj Mahal has recently been voted the number one. I think September is a very good month to go to India, there's a lot of cloud coverage and the even at times get rain. It started raining a little at the Taj but to be honest it's impossible not to get beautiful pictures. We went to the Taj for sunset and sunrise, and even though we had to be up very early for the sunrise it was certainly worth it. We were rewarded with a beautiful morning with far less people traffic. You are not allowed to go too near thye Taj by car you literally have to get a battery operated rickshaw to the entrance gates. The guide was so informative about the history of this beautiful mausoleum, with its symmetrical lines and optical illusions.
</br>
After the Taj we went to a leather shop, which supplies the leather jackets for River Island, and has indeed made leather trench coats for Bill Clinton. I spent another bucket load here, but it was my birthday so I didn't begrudge it, and I decided beforehand that I was not going to deprive myself of anything, that if I liked something andI could justify getting it, it was going to be got. Besides they gave me 4 beautiful camels, and a very appealing leather whip. The shop is extremely innocuous from the outside, its tiny and they have sewing machines in the back room. I got a pair of leather pants, tailor-made there and then, they take your measurements and will make all the necessary adjustments, and deliver it to your hotelroom later on that same day. This seems to be quite a common theme, I got a number of clothes tailor-made.
</br>
The next morning we took a train, and the final car journey to Khajaraho. This quiet unassuming town is home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a breathing complex of temples. What was one of the highlights of the entire trip for me, was the sound and light show at these temples. It was so much like being transported back in time. These temples are also the home of the Kama Sutra, and erotic carvings are everywhere. They certainly lived in an age which had no hangups. Also the immaculately maintained gardens are full of the most amazingly scented flowers. The only downfall in this town was the Clark's Hotel we stayed at, did not have a wide enough bathroom door. This was the only time that this happened in any of the hotels we stayed at. We started eating out near to our hotel to cut down on rooml service charges.There was a restaurant called Gaylords Restaurant, which served the most excellent food at very cheap prices. Its more or less a one man show, the owner is both cook and waiter. One evening we were in there having our dinner, when my ears stood up listening to four people speaking beside me. It turned out they were from Tallaght, which was almost unbelieveable. They were so nice and so funny, but the one thing that I felt bad for them, was because they had no ininerary. Its such a shame to travel that far and not to make the most of your surroundings. At least I can look back now and rest assured that I really did make the very most of my time there.
</br>
The aarti cermeony was so touching. The co-ordinated movements of the 7 young trainee Hindu priests, with their lights, and strong smell of insense was captivating. The chanting, and the genuine palpable happiness of the people, was so special to behold and thankfully I have it on video. After the ceremony we went to a Hindu temple where prayers for my own intentions were said. It was so much better to see it at night time, that we did not go back in the morning as originally planned. Varanasi is famous for silk, and I stocked up on fabulous bed/pillow covers (which are still in a bag, as I feel they are too nice to use) The owner of the silk emporium where we went, said that silk does not degrade, or lose its value over time, and that certain people actually collect, old silk. I should have bought more, as it is so light in weight, and therefore ideal for the plane.
Thankfully, the last leg of the trip, was to the holy Hindu city of Varanasi which we arrived at by domestic flight (my ass just could not handle another long car journey) Many times I felt deeply moved by the Hindu beliefs. We went to the Hindu festival of Aarti, which was almost a mystical experience. They put me on a boat, which rocked so ferociously that I almost puked. Again I had an excellent tour guide who explained everything in such detail with regard to their beliefs, that it makes me annoyed at how arrogant the Christian tradition is towards it. Ok it is fantastical with all their Gods, but it is certainly no more farfetched than other religious belief systems. We took the boat up to the ghat, which is the 24 hour cremation area in the Ganges. It was a little strange to behold bodies being burned openly, but according to Hindu beliefs, once the person is dead and the soul is</br>

The last day was spent with a visit to a school for disabled Indians called Kiran. I had lots of sweets and presents with me. I honestly cannot fathom what it is like to be disabled, to be wheelchair user, and to be Indian. You certainly are relegated to the back room, and that is even providing that your family will not abandon, you as we saw later in the day when we went to a Missionaries Of Charity Orphanage. Unfortunately i have no video of this, just some wonderful pictures, but the atmosphere was so joyful. Again I had lots of little presents and chocolates, and the head sister told me that mother is looking after them from heaven, as the order is going from strength to strength.
</br>
After a short domestic flight we were back in Delhi, and had a few hours to put in before the flight. There was a mishap at the airport. I had bargained on changing and organising my bags inside the airport. However the airport security threw a spanner in the works, as they would not allow my assistant inside. So we had to make do with trying to repack my luggage and change in the street( with the help of a blanket) Again there were serious problems with the airport staff, who told me that I would have to wait until the cabin crew came, and they would have to approve me before they let me on the plane. It was 10 o clock at night- I was starving and exhausted. But after a drink and something to eat, my energy levels came back up, and I decided that this was not going to be another Heathrow fiasco. I told them there would be big problems if I could not get on this plane, and that I had let KLM know the medical situation months in advance. When the cabin crew, came we had a little chat and there was no problem. They told me that there had been a few occasions before where unaccompanied disabled passangers perhaps had tried to use the on-board loo unsuccessfullyand then sued KLM.I just wanted to get on the plane, and did not calm down until we had taken off. I had had the most incredible holiday, but all good things come to an end and I was really looking forward to collapsing into my own bed. It was tough going but it certainly was worth it !</div>
<p class="heading">London</p>
<div class="content"><img src="Images/london1.0.JPG" width="600" height="338" margin-left: 500px;> </p>
  <p>London was amazing! This five day break was my birthday present to myself. It took me thirty six years to get here, but better late than never .Got myself an assistant, and was good to go. I thought I had planned everything down to the last, but when I got to Heathrow there was nobody waiting for me at the gate. On the verge of a coronary, I knew that our plan B for me to get to the hotel and to wait for him was never going to happen. I had too many bags, including my laptop, but when the assistant showed up two hours later( it turned out he was in Terminal 3, while I was in Terminal 1: Heathrow i a labarynth), I nearly cried with relief, and the holiday could well and truly begin .
</br>
Day 1 : After the fiasco at the airport, there was no way we could deal with the rigours of the Tube. So we ended up paying a sixty pound cab to the hotel ( which we later learned should only have been forthy five tops. This was my first experience of a London cab , and I was a little shocked. Over the next five days we took a lot of cabs, but all the cabs were devoid of clamps. So, you can get into the cab no problem in the chair,but you are not secure, and there is nothing even to hold onto. I would never recommend someone in a wheelchair to get into one of these cabs on therir own. Only for my assistant, there were a few times when the chair actually tipped up. Its a fairly hair-raising experience, and I cannot believe that even for insurance reasons , this is the case. It must have something to do with not wanting to deface the look of the cabs by not wanting to have clamp holes in the floor.
</br>
All the buses are wheelchair accessible, but we settled for cabs everywhere, as we were on holidays and wanted to squeeze the most out of the few days , not really wanting to be tied to bus route maps. This turned out to be a wise decision, as there was a Tube strike Monday and Tuesday, and some bicycle protest on Sunday. We stayed in the Kensington Copethorne Tara. As the taxi man soon told us later on its wheelchair accessible but not immediately close to any of the attractions (not totally true, a 5 pound taxi will get you to hyde park). It was a nice enough hotel, in a nice quiet plush area of London, which we got for seven hundred and three dollars. It had a bath (my preference) with overhead shower. Grips and rails aplenty, but a bit of a squeeze to reverse out in my manual chair. I had forgotten to bring my better cushion, so for five days had to improvise by wrapping a jumper around the crap cushion, to pad it out a bit.
</p>


<p>
After a rest and a settling in, we began to make our way to the Victoria Palace to see the musical Billy Elliott. I was very impressed by the architecture, the sumptuous housess of the recession immune. It was obvious that London/England was the one time ruler of the world. We went see Billy Elliott, and Wicked, and both times I was impressed how good they were for wheelchairs. They have stair climbers at the front and inside the theatres. The pavements are smooth and tapered down at the end. I was very impressed by the play Billy Elliott. I had booked it over the internet, and collected the tickets at the box office. The production was great, very true to the original film, and no signs of arthritis in the cast. How they could dance and belt out the songs for three hours, with only a twenty minute interval is beyond me. The sets were amazing, with two story rooms coming up out of the ground and scenes being effortlessly changed. You were really drawn into the play and transported to a diferent world. Apparently Elton John composed the music for it, and it is one of the most successful musicals around. After the musical we went around Victoria station. Even at eleven at night it was crammed with stag party goers and booze cruisers. But after the rough day, I was just glad to be here, and not on a return flight to dublin.

<h1>Day 2:Sat 4th september</h1>
<p>
We consistently never made it for breakfast (not included in the room bill), but who cares. Thanks to a tip from a friendly cab driver, I held on for dear life as we made our way to the westfield shopping cente. A shopping centre is a shopping centre, so we just filled in one of the vast restaurants ( I went for thai food with english sticky pudding for desert, I stocked up in the lush shop, then off we went to hyde park andd the diana memorial. Have always been a fan of di, and it was great to see her old stomping ground, from the harvey nicholl' in knightsbridge to the area she lived in when she was still a sloan ranger The Albert Memorial is veryimpressive, situated opposite The Royal Albert Hall. Hyde Park was full of joggers and cyclists, and from there we actually walked back to , what would become my favourite restaurant, an Italian in Kensington called Cafe Concierto.
</br>
</br>
</p>
<h1>Day 3 : Sun 5th Septmeber</h1>
  <img src="Images/london2.JPG" width="600" height="338"> </p>

<p>
Sunday at twelve we decided to head off to the london eye. There were some cyclists march/protest on, so we had to weave our way around the back roads towards central London. 
</br>The place was absolutely jammed. I had brought my own laptop, my 3 dongle worked perfectly in London with no roaming charge, so I could book the tickets for London Eye, the Aquarium, Madame Toussauds , and the Dungeon on-line that morning. This is very effective as the tickets are waiting for you and it also meant I did'nt have to pay the fifteen pounds a day connection the hotel would have charged.
</br> London Eye was magnificent. We didn't do the boat ride as apparently they are a seperate company There is plenty of space inside the capsule and even the chatterings of a large group of Indians, and the crying and cursing of a presumed druggie could not put me off. I felt so thrilled to be up here. The capsule actually stops for a few miniutes, so you can really take in the panorama. Security is quite strict, they do a sweep of the capsules before and after, and a big crane comes outside and takes a group photo. 
</br>Even though I hate doing touristy crap I had to buy the photo. One of the best things for me was before you board the London Eye, you can see a 4D animated preview ( this is included with your ticket I think) Iy was amazing , birds flying around you that you could almost feel you could touch, alongside rain that you could actually feel ( this was the 4D part) We went to the London Aquarium , that was basically around ten metres away . It was very impressive. Huge tanks deep underground, but with way too many children , and after a while I felt very claustrophobic. 
</p>
<img src="Images/london3.JPG" width="600" height="338"> </p>
<p>
</br>After this we took a taxi to Madame Tousauds (too far away to avoid this unfortunately, cost 14 quid)It certainly did live up to its reputation. We did the chamber of horrors trip and we could actually see how they make models. Then thanks to another cabby tip, we went around the corner to Baker Street and the Sherlock Homes Museum.
</br> Although I couldn't get into the house naturally, there was only one step up to the gift shop. The shop itself was like something out of the eighteenth century, with the shop assistants dressed in peroid costumes ( one of them was from Baltinglass, and a Trinity student). More touristy shopping along the streets, and then back to the Italian restaurant, terrible creature of habit that I am.
</p>

</p>
<h1>Day 4 Monday 6th September</h1>
</br>
<p>
My birthday, and the main reason behind this trip, saw us taxing our way to buckingham palace. I had bought the tickets online, and as were ahead of schedule, we went into the victoria and albert exhibition next door.I had the same reaction here, as in buck palace as I had at the vatican. It was just too much! Its lovely that the art and history is preserved, but I was left thinking about the dickensian age, and the workhouses, or the tough wartimes with people on strict rations, and yet these people lived like this! Wheelchair users go in through a separate entrance. with complete lift access provided. Only allowed to take video/photo's facing away from the palace. It was nice to see, but I wouldn't be in a rush to see it again. The tea and custard pastries in the garden cafe were worth it. Don't understand the fuss over english breakfast tea. Met a friend who lives in london from secondary school days, then back to cafe concierto. 
</p>

<h1>Day 5: Tuesday 7th September</h1>
<p>
My friend had told us about the roofto gardens , owned by Richard Branson. They are well worth a visit, but the pricelist was too high, and my rumbling belly drew me back to my old haunt. There was a wholefoods store,apparently an american store which sells only organic food (some of it horrible), but I could finally get my honeybush tea. 
</br>Huge lift to all three floors. We had begun the process of packing son as not to leave it all until the last moment. I booked the musical Wicked online at the apollo victoria. This magical play was to become one of the highlights for me, and a perfect way to end the trip. From the outset, I knew there was no point in trying to do all the sights. London isn't going anywhere, and hopefully, I'll be back. Even though my flight the next day was not until 3.50pm, we were determained not to risk anything.
</p>
<img src="Images/london4.JPG" width="600" height="338"> </p>
<p>
</br> A light lunch in the hotel, and then the whole airport ordeal, thankfully without a hitch this time. Aer lingus are always great in my exfperience, and its only a 50 minute trip.

This whole trip strengthened me in so many ways. Over the past few months, I really felt like I had reached the end of the line, an unemployable, physically defunct, onlooker of life. It has done me the world of good, to know that I can still do trips like this. All is not lost!

<div class="content">

 <h1> Nov 24-Dec 9th 2006 </h1>
<p>
I had originally planned to go to cape town in september with BA through heathrow, but after a full day of negotiating through the airports of two different countries, I was refused admission onto the flight as I was unaccompanied. Well my confidence wazs totally shot after this episode, and its not a nice feeling to think that you might not be in a position to board a plane and travel again.
</br>
The BA manager kindly let me phone Alfie of Epic Enabled tours in south africa, to bring them up to speed with the latest developements, and to let them know that there would be no reason for them to be at cape town airport at 7 am the next morning. I was given a bus and hotel room voucher and told to be back at the airport the next morning at eight. I was in deep shock, but also angry at myself, for all the time spent attending to the details of the trip, as opposed to a realistic evaluation of my physical condition. Was it wise for me to try and go to cape town via heathrow on my own, and what about using the loo?
</br>
I don't believe all things happen for a reason, but I do believe in making the best out of the circumstances of any given situation. So, this crushing scenario certainly caused me to stop rethink and re-evaluate. Went back to work on the tuesday, and the long struggle to get a refund for my flight tickets began. I was also left very embittered by my experiences with the travel insurance company. I thought I had a very good case, all my luggage had been taken off my plane, but put onto another one, and wound up in cape town anyway. I now fully realise that insurance companies do not make money, by paying out too often. So, for broken or lost items in my luggage which made it back to me a week later I got ZERO.
</br>
I think it speaks volumes of our society that upon hearing of my case, so many people told me to sue. I honestly don't knw how so many people have just the plain energy to do that, and to gather all the detaails required. I just wanted to salvage as much of my money as possible and plan for something else.I have no anger for BA, but I do certainly think that they should put their hands up,and clearly say that because,as I was told, of numerous lawsuits, that they will offer no assistance whatsoever to any wheelchair using passenger travelling unaccompanied. That would have saved me a lot of hassle, but hopefully I'll be able to get this message out through this website.
</br>
I don't want to go into the saga of trying to get my money back, because thankfully now it is all in the past, but suffice it to say, it was an unbelievable and draining nightmare, which was only resolved by threat of legal action.You get to see the real side of people, when something goes wrong, and you want your money back. Everyone is all smiles and cheerful voiced, when they are taking down your credit card details.
</br>
Around the middle of october in work, a fax came through with Slatetry Travel's summer sale, with direct flights from dublin to cape town. Long story short, I snagged a return flight for just over 600 euro, which was an immediate saving of 420 euro on the BA flight, so I was back in business.The trip was back on, it was very easy to restart eveything on the south african side, but I was ptrified about the flight, and dreading any repeat performance, sent faxes and medical certs to Slattery's until I received written and verbal confirmation, that the airline were fully aware that I was coming and of my situation. The local nurse familiarised me with a catheter, as I didn't want to take any chance, and so the toilet would not be an issue.
</br>
<h1>Cape point, meeting of indian & atlantic oceans</h1>
<p>
</br>
I really wanted to organise the trip as soon as possible. Especially in my situation, I cannot afford to put anything on the long finger.I was originally told that maybe I could hookup with a group leaving from heathrow in may 07, but honestly that seemed like an eternity away, and who knows what sort of physical condition I'll be in then!
</br>
As Friday nov 24th approached, I was petrified of course, but I also knew so many people were sending me good vibes for a great trip. I had visions of being turfed off, but at least I would be in my own country, my mobile would work, and family members would be nearby.Yes, there are definate advantages to flying direct. Also, the hassle assolciated with having to get a connecting flight, and having to have your chair and luggagemoved is eliminated. I was bringing my new super dooper chair, which took me a year and a half to get,and is the cost of a good used car. From the moment we arrived at the airport (at 5am), I knew things were going to work out this time.I sailed throuh the security checkpoint, and chatted with some of the other passengers. What a great time of the year it is to be getting away. It was freexing as usual in dublin. I can't say I relaxed until we were actually airborne!
</br>
I didn't realise that on charter planes, if you want to watch a movie, or whatever music is on that you have to pay for the earphones. I was too cheap, and reslolved to read my book. BIG MISTAKE! You can't read or chat for twelve hours, and the seat I was in was adjacent to the kitchen, so I couldn't even recline the seat, so having a nap was out ! It pissed me off when guys at the back, came up to their friends beside me and told them if they wanted a snooze, they should go down to the back, where everyone had a row to themselves. Yes, the plane was not half full!
</br>
By the time we had landed in and cleared all the checkpoints in capetown, it was nearly 11pm. Good old Alfie was ready and waiting to bring me back to their house in fish hoek. It was the best thing to stay with a family, not only did it work out much haper, but for me it meant there was always somebody around and there was a lovely family atmosphere. If I wanted to use the net, I just popped into their office, or watched tv on the big screen one in the sitting room. Little joshua was evicted from his room for my two weeks, and I quickly made it unrecognisable with all my clutter.
</br>
Quickly I knew that an assistant for help showering and dressing would be essential. Kurt proved to be the best money that I spent there. He also provided great companionship, and being a native helped me avoid the tourist pitfalls.The itinerary was tailor made, and alfie regularly came to me with recommendations and tips. For example, there was a full day marked for a visit to three winefarms in stellenbosch, but alfie said that given the fact that I am not a winedrinker, that this would be a waste of time. So we spent half the dau at the stunning spier winefarm and the rest shopping. I had vowed that given the fact that it had taken me so long to get here, that I was not going to pennypinch or go home with any retail regrets, so if I liked something I got it!(Given this gung ho attitude towards shopping, and my weakness for curios of all kinds, its no surprise that I was 4 times overweight at the luggage check in on the return leg).
</br>
<h1>Female ostrich at the cape of good hope</h1>
<p>
</br>
I said to alfie several times that it just isn't fair, that they have all this stunning scenary plus beach weather right on their doorstep. I know ireland can be similarly fantastic, but who in their right mind wants to be out in the pissing rain! It was truly fantastic to come from winter weather, to sitting in tshirt and shorts having a drink, and reading a book under cloudless skies. The warm weather really agrees with me, my muscles relax, and having such a fantastic assistant it was truly a holiday, without even a hint of ordeal.
</br>
Coming from rip off ireland, I was stunned by the cheapness of eating out. A party of five of us went to a fantastic italian restaurant in muizenberg, starters, drinks, dessert, main course, the lot came to just over 53 euro. And this is top notch food, jesus, I ate like a pig for my two weeks! I was also very glad to see how well the transition seems to be going in south africa. My coloured assistant was treated with he same respect as myself. Three years ago in johannesburg, my one abiding memory is of a very noticeable separation based on colour. In restaurants whites would be at a table, and I felt they talked down to those who were black. I anticipated this degree of snobbery in cape town, especially as I had been told before I went, that the western cape was the most european part of south africa, with whites outnumbering blacks 5:1.
</br>
There is still definately a way to go though. Tne shanty towns are there but not in your face. What is very much in your face is the level of luxury, opulence and excess enjoyed by so many. Some of the houses were truly palatial, but as I stayed in a well known retirement resort, there were in a lot of cases, probably two or even one person rattling around in them. They seem to be doing a good job with crime, I felt absolutely safe and had never had an unsafe feeling. Granted I had an assisstant who could withdraw my money from the atm, and could pay for whatever I bought, rather than having me with my clumsy hands, broadcasting the contents of my wallet, as would normally be the case.
</br>
As it was a private tour, the schedule could be readjusted according to whether I was tired or interested in doing a particular thing. It was completely tailored. The first week, most of the big trips were done,and then alfie had to leave to do two more tours in kruger. So, then next week had to be quieter,but we stilll managed to fit in great halfn day trips to the world of birds, shopping at the waterfront and the awe inspiring kirstenbosch botanical gardens, ( I brought home heaps of seed, and really hope they will sprout next summer) where I was just dumbstruck by the fabulous colours!
</br>
I never knew south africa was famous for its wool, which comes from the eastern cape. I spent a fortune on cardigans, scarves, sheepskin boots and slippers, and was undoubtedly the best prepared for the winter weather we would soon return to. The markets and shops were nowhere near as cheap as joberg, but I think I did ok. I despise with a passion, tourist crap, the stuff you buy as proof that you were there, but who will in all likelihood never have any practical use once you get home, and the holiday turns into a memory.
</br>
So, I'm back home to winter wind and rain, but all the effort to get there was definately worth it! 2 precious weeks!
</br>
The following is an account of my first trip to johannesburg 3 years ago;
</br>
I think any sort of world travel is invaluable, and such an education in its own right. To step out of your own little routine, and see the bigger picture, can only be enlightening on so many different levels. 2 years ago I came across this website run by a husband and wife team, who organised accessible safari's in south Africa.
</br>
I would never have imagined a trip like that, and as I was well and truly tired of being the one who received postcards from friends in such far flung places as Sydney, Victoria falls, china etc, I decided I would make the effort to go. This was my first major trip. When a wheelchair becomes part of your life, the world and the options open to you tend to narrow considerably. Everything has to be viewed in terms of accessibility and other details which often make a trip overwhelming.
</br>
For example, I am dying to go to the u.s, and even though now I have a job and money, I start factoring in transfers, how long the flight will be, what about the loo, when I get to the destination, steps, will I be spending all my money on taxi's to get around, safety, kerbs…..To be honest , it all inevitably adds up to the break not being a holiday and more of a survival course.
</br>
With Epic Enabled, all that worry is completely taken away. In the lead up to the trip, I was TERRIFIED about the 9 hour flight especially as I am an insulin dependant diabetic as well. It started off quite shakily, as first I had to go to London heathrow. The flight from Dublin was late, and as I had only half an hour to traverse heathrow to get to terminal 1, the first thing I heard when I touched down was "he's not going to make it". The only thing that saved me was the fact that my luggage in dublin had been designated straight through to Johannesburg. If I had to collect my luggage and try to transfer them again onto the Johannesburg bound flight, I would not have made it.
</br>
Luckily in this age of security, a flight will not take off with luggage when the owner of that luggage is not present. With a mixture of relief, a red face, excitement and hope that the rest of the trip would not contain anymore worrisome surprises, I was placed in my seat at the back near the loo. I do not handle stress of any sort well. Its really something I need to work on, there really is no point getting worked up about something that will soon be a memory.
</br>
Thankfully I was seated beside a very nice English woman and thanks also to a little creative manipulation with my insulin, I only needed the toilet once. I won't beat around the bush here, as there was not enough room to get in, it was literally point and shoot. A no 2 would be out of the question and I'd imagine it would be very awkward for girls. The last couple of years living with FA has put me in some scenarios I never could have imagined dealing with years ago, and so as a result I tend to have very few scruples left. On reflection its not a bad thing, we tend to waste too much time worryinabout how we look to others, and in the process blow it all out of proportion. How do we know, or why should we care, what another supposedly thinks of us?
</br>
I think I was too nervous to get much sleep and divided my time between the online movie, chatting with Carol beside me and just being lost in thoughts about what the next 10 days held in store.At least I had made my flight and was actually en route to johannesburg.When we finally did touch down it was 9.10am, and it was a nice bright morning. The guy pushing me through the terminal made me feel very uneasy by asking me for money. I didnt know what to say. He had an airport job, so he could'nt be that badly off. I was very relieved as just in the middle of that awkward silence, Alfie & Sabine came up to me.
</br>
I changed some dollars ( I was told to bring dollars which in retrospect was a mistake, as the euro exchange rate against the rand is stronger) and we made our way in the amazingingly engineered vehicle (look in the gallery)the short distance to our compound. One of the immediate things that struck me was how despite being at the edge almost of another continent, how many similarities there were. English was spoken everywhere, people drove on the left and there were white people everywhere. The compound where we were staying actually had an on site motel. This place was fantastic, very plush, weeping willows on the grounds and dirt cheap. That was to be a recurring theme in south africa, we were living like kings for nothing, and coming from rip off ireland that was almost shocking to me.
</br>
Johannesburg is not a safe city at all. Indeed towards the end of the trip, the office staff could not get in, as the road outside had been cordoned off after a shootout during which eight were shot trying to hijack a security van. Inside I had a great nights sleep. I had a day on my own before the other two members in the group were to arrive from england, so I decided to go to the waterfront shopping area. I thought I had died and gone to heaven! It was a market area more or less. One of the shops there (see the gallery) sold the most amazing 3D brass ornaments. The tribal scene with the 3D elephants and the brass clock are among my most prized possessions. They almost light up when the sun hits them, and are priceless momentos to me, despite the effort involved in bringing them home.
</br>
I remember having lunch with Alfie & Sabine out on a restaurant terrace with a lot of workers toiling away revamping the area. Alfie told me that they were more than likely working for approx $1 a day. Time and time again during my stay, this was to be a recurring theme that will stay with you long after you have packed your bags and left. Its almost two years later now, and I am disgusted with myself for having clothes and stuff that I have barely used (if at all). When I get my act together I am going to sell them all on ebay. I view shopping now in a different light.You can only wear one item at a time so there's something wrong if you have a room covered in unused or barely used clothes as well as, in my case figurines, candles, buddhas, native american works etc. I think I have collected so much bits n bobs as a way of compensating myself for never having been to their country of origin.
</br>
Anyway, when Roger and Marie had arrived and settled in, we began our drive to Kruger. There was of course LOTS of travelling in the "tank" involved. Usually we'd be up and driving from 7am. It was a little difficult to register sometimes that you are near the end of a different continent, when there were so many familiarities around. Sometimes we'd stop for something to eat and the loo, and there would be little red haired childen running around with everyone speaking english and the cars mbeing driven on the left. However the apartheid legacy is always just below the surface. Except in one or two cases, all the staff wherever we went were black and the clientele white. We were eating and drinking like kings throughout the stay, for next to nothing, and thankfully myself, Roger & Marie gelled well from the very beginning, which does make all the difference. Plenty of jokes and stories definately help when you are strapped in place in the truck for hours. I choose to stay in my chair as my trunk muscles now are very weak, and it would be inviting an injury if I didn't.
</br>
Our first stop and where we were to spend a couple of days was Tschukudu game park, and that stay there embodied many of the reasons I had come to South Africa in the first place. I really dislike zoo's, I know they serve a function, but I always feel sorry for the animals. They are just caged objects to be gawked at. It is another experience entirely to be a humble spectator on the animals territory. It really is something else to be in bed and to hear the non stop animal noised, be it of birds, lions, baboons or who knows. It certainly wasn't an uneasy feeling, for me they were sounds I personally thought I'd never hear.It was only later that I found out how close we were to sun city, the south african version of las vegas. But in retrospect maybe it was better that it wasn't on the agenda. This trip really was all about the animals. Its very educational and also very animal welfare motivating, because once you see the majesty of these places, and the way these animals have adapted, survived and thrived in these places, long before man entered the picture, you really are made aware of the value of preservation. I have to admit I am an animal lover. There is something very pure and just in their lives. To think that an enormous majestic elephant can be eradicated by one cowardly bullet makes me fume.
</br>
The picture of me with the cheetah was amazing. We had been told about this hand reared cheetah named savannagh, whose mother had rejected her at birth. They were trying to re acclimatise her to the wild and to teach her how to survive on her own. To this end she would go on hunts, and not be seen in the camp for 2 or 3 days, so it was going to be pure chance whether we got to see her at all.We had boarded the bus and were ready to leave, when one of the reserve workers hurried out to tell us that savannah had returned. To be beside this cheetah was indescribable, to hear her very loud and contented purrs. Because she had been hand reared, she had absolutely no fear of humans, and was a curious mix of domestic pet and powerful wild animal.It was a definate highlight for me and thankfully the pictures captured the rare and great occasion.
</br>
There were so many special moments that just engrave themselves in your memory, like picking up a feather from a wild bird, and just the smells and colours. Passing by miles and miles of orange grove and the majesty of Pilgrim's Rest and God's window make you understand why they say that if you only visit one country in your lifetime, make it south africa. I could have happily spent forever browsing through the markets, to the point where I was beginning to make myself unpopular with the other two in the group. We would be on a tight schedule, alfie would need a quick pit stop, and the hawkers would seize the opportunity to come up selling their goods and I just HAD to indulge. The state of me coming home with clocks, books, everything and anything to do with elephants, ostrich eggs, amazingly engraved bowls,keyrings, t shirts and candles was comical I'm sure.
</br>
I never would have thought that I'd lose appreciation of the sight of animals in the wild, but you do become blase. After the novelty wears off its literally oh there's another elephant, giraffe, kudu etc. A word of caution while I remember, if possible do not bring a new wheelchair with you. Its an unforgiving schedule and terrain. I had gotten a new chair the week before I went, but luckily I brought the older one which they could still fold down and store onboard. It actually endured well out there ( the spokes went, but alfie could fix them), but when I arrived back in dublin, I was told my chair was still in london. I had anticipated something like this, so it was good to have not parted with my chair, although to give credit where its due they had my old chair couriered down before midnight of the same day.
</br>
I really regret not going on to cape town, but that would have entailed another flight change and so I left it. Now almost two years and a marked physical deterioration later, I honestly am not sure if I'd be able for that trip. So to anyone reading this, who is in two minds about going, I would say "seize the opportunity, because you dont know whats around the corner". It is very empowering and life changing in a lot of ways. I used to buy clothes and so much knick knacks that I could barely turn in my bedroom, and I am ashamed to say that I have clothes which I have never worn or worn at the most once or twice. Its likv I was buying in to the spend spend materialistic culture. Without getting preachy, how many clothes can you wear at any one time, and when you see grown men toiling away for a dollar a day, of course your values and priorities change. I know mine have!
</br>
A link to a webpage about other accessible travel. I have a week off work at the end of may, coinciding with joe's respite holiday. So I've got to go somewhere for a week. I don't want to completely break the bank, so its really helpful to come across webpages like the one above. A holiday sounds like the perfect antidote to isolation and the depression of living in a cold wheelchair UNfriendly country.
</br>
The experiences and insight, gleaned from a good holiday are invaluable.Since that trip, I found anothere tour group on the net, which offered wheelchair accessible tour of argentina and chile. It was proving to be a trip, which would dwarf, in terms of effort and energy, the south african trip. To even begin the tour in Buenos Aires, I would first have to go to munich, and from there a 14 hour onward flight to BA.
</div>


<p class="heading">Italy</p>
<div class="content"><p>For a country which is only a 2 1/2 hour direct flight away,it is truly a shame not to see italy and all it has to offer! I found this company on the net, who offer wheelchair accessssible tours of italy. I had been quoted 7000 euro by another accesssible italy company some timee ago, for a so so 10 day itinerary with lots of half day tours.. Now, just what the fuck I am supposed to do on my own for a half day is beyond me, but suffffice it to say,. it did'nt seem liike great value for money. Thats where Vincenzo steps in.
</br>
I only stumbled upon his site, I think from a link from another happy reviewer. We started planning this trip s 4ix months ago, and if I had any doubts or fears, he would phone me, which went way above the call of duty, and let me know that I was dealing with a genuinne professsionnal person, whose aim, from tthe outset was for me to have an unfogettable italian holiday, and to go home and spread the word.. I hope to do so in this account.
</br>
You pay in advance by sterling bank transfer. You get what you pay for, and I had spent a lot for a wheelchair accessible van and driver. This was hard on my ass, but ultimately the best way to see the real italy. The countryside is like something out of a storybook, with sweeping valleys aand crowded mountains, usually topped with a fantastic old church. On the day went to napless, sssorento and pompeii from our base in san felice circeo it was apparently a 600km round trip, so the money was well spent.
</br>
He is not running a charity ( he said that word offends him), but as he also poignantly said "the only free things in life are birth and death". But he does offer excellent value for money, and after being burned by the greedy indians last year, it was refreshing to eee someone operaate out of purer motives other than tip pursuit!
</br>
Aer lingus are great. I expected no problems, other than the fact that I had to be in the airport by 4.30am. The reason I like aer lingus, is becaue they are not inflexible.With some airlines if yourr ticket says 6B, you are going there,, even if it means people have to climb over you. Not so with aer lingus, and even on the way back, because the plane was not full, they reshuffled seats, so that I could have a free seat beside me, if I needed a snooze (is the pope catholic?) I was lucky to have the window seats (both times) and it was great flying over the swiss alps. Plus I was beside nice people, and had none of the toilet concerns asociated with long haul flights.
</br>
I arrived in the land of beautiful people at 11am, which meant I had the full day more or less. For schedule reasons, we had to drive two hours south of rome to san felice circeo first, a fabulous seaside town,a popular weekend retreat forr romans. En route we stoped at Castel Romano,, a huge deesigner outlet village.I was really only looking for sunglasssses, but thiss place is only for fashion label sluts, and even if valentino hhd a 99.% sale, he would be still be beyond my budget. I am more comfortable getting my bargains at market stalls.

May is a perfect time to visit italy. I was surprised at how lusccious and green the countryside was. VIncenzo said its a different story in july or august, with the breath taking vistas being sun scorched.The hotel Villa della Mercedes, was a former religious run orphanage, which offered stunning views and a large room (I don't think I ever slept as soundly as that first night). There is not much in the town, but the old town is majestic. Its way up a hill, and again having your own transport is a must.
</br>
Italy must be exhausting even for the very physically fit,but if you have any disability,you have to provide your own transport. Apparently taxi's are a rip off, and wheelchair cabs practically non existent. What a shame it would be to go all that way, and not see the stunning sites because their off up a hill. But that's italy for you,and for a wheelchair user without proper planning, I'm sure could easily be a nightmare. Of course, I took the easy route, just paid and left the hard part to vincenzo. By the way Vincenzo's company is a one man band. He does not have a big team behind him, and oversees everything himself.
</br>
The first full day in Italy we spent travelling to the stunning abbey of Montecassino, which has to be seen to be believed. It is a Benedictine abbey perched way up atop a mountain. We zigzagged our way up these corkscrew roads but the views from the top were well worth it. The abbey itself could easily have ranked as one of the wonders of the world, and apparently gained notoriety during World War 2 when it was occupied by the Germans. It would have been exremely difficult for the monks to walk all the way up to the abbey from the towns below in the time before cars, and maybe thats why they created such an idyllic retreat, especially as they are an enclosed order.
</br>
From there we went on to the historic town of Gaeta with its ancient fortress overlooking the town. It was here that I got a phone call from Milan, Gian Piero was checking to see if I was ok. He had contacted me through my website a couple of months ago , and is heavily involved in FA_babelFAmily, a multilingual mailing list dedicated to FA. His dedication is amazing, and I really appreciated the phone call. It was here also that i got my first pair of cheap sunglasses, and yet another visit to get the famous italian gelati.I dont know why Italians put whipped cream on their ice cream. For me this was too much. You certainly are in carbohydrate country. For breakfast I would have so many pastries with chocolate inside, that they soon ran out of them in San Felice.
</br>
Looking around the town of Gaeta you could always feel the presence of the ancient Romans. History is everywhere, almost around every corner there was something spectacular to witness. That afternoon the skies were actually a bit grey, but on the whole I was extremely lucky with the weather. Back to the hotel, and because on my reliance on the attendant, I would be in bed by half nine, not that there was much to see outside.
</br>
It is always hard on the first day to be discussing personal issues with a complete stranger, especailly one that has little or no english. The assistant Vincenzo and I met earlier in the day, to discuss my needs and wants, with Vincenzo's translating help. It is always better to have a male assistant . Perhaps in the future I need to bring one of my own, but it all boils down to money, and this was by far the cheaper option, to have an assistant in the morning and evening , and Vincenzo's help during the day.
</br>
The next day our ultimate destination was Sorrento and Pompeii, passing through Naples on the way. I really dont have enough words to describe Sorrento. It was just like you would picture a millionaires playground to be like. We got off at one of the little streets close to the beach, but I lived up to my reputation, by heading right for the shops. I bought a leather bag and shoes, and came across one great shop that makes soaps etc from lemons. I know Sorrento is also famous for its inlaid wood. As nice as they were, they were a bit touristy and expensive.
</br>
For me I've got to be able to justify everything I buy. Also I have to admit to being very selfish while abroad, I am not one of these people who feels they have to buy some little souveneir for everyone at home. This was my holiday, I had planned and prepared for this week for the last 6 months, so yes it was all about me. Pompeii was also amazing. I think we were the last visitors allowed in. Even the market stallers were packing up. I had no idea that Pompeii was actually a huge sophisticated city. Vincenzo said that when he was young he came with his family, and he was so exhaused because they literally spent the whole day walking around. For a wheelchair user , there are only a few places you can get around with assistance, but for me this was enough. In these situations, I gave the video camera to Julio and he could walk around taking video , for later inspection. But to be honest it all looks more or less the same after a while.
</br>
The next day ,Tuesday was a quiet affair. After 3 days of hard going, my ass was in bits, and looking forward to a much needed rest. We just went to the Village market where I got some great cheap things, like towels, a bag, and underwear. The beach in San Felice now was practically deserted, but the sea air was so fresh. We just lazed around, had a meal, and tried to get our energy levels up for our trip to Rome the next day.
</br>
Before Rome the next day, we stopped off at a farm, close to us , which sells natural honey. I did take 6 or 7 jars which in retrospect was'nt the smartest thing to do, as it weighed down my luggage. I had most of my shopping done before Rome. On the way up we called in at the church of St, Thomas Acquinas, where he lived and died. After all the effort to get out and go down to the doors, the notice on it said it would not be open till 3. So the question for me was whether I wanted to wait 40 minutes, after a while all churches look the same , and I did'nt regret my decision on my way to Rome!
</br>
It was 5pm , by the time we reached our hotel,Villa EUR in Rome, but unfortunately it was the first time we hit a snag. The wheelchair accessible van which was supposed to be organised for us was apruptly cancelled at the last minute. So here I was stuck in a lovely hotel on the Pallotine hill with no way of seeing the main reason for coming on this trip. Poor Vincenzo was even more distressed than i was. I somehow knew that this hitch would have a positive conclusion, and thanks to the net, he found another company, which could provide a half day tour on Thursday, full day on Friday, and transport back to the airport on Saturday.
</br>
Thursday was indeed my favourite day, and the city definitely lived up to its reputation. We did all the usually touristy things , the Colliseum, the Trevi fountain,the Spanish Steps, Venice Square etc. Vincenzo is from Rome, so it was great having his expertise, showing me around his own city. He said that when they were young, himself and his sister would play hide and seek at the Colliseum. You are almost afraid to close your eyes, as around every corner there is something more amazing than the next. It is like one vast open museum.
</br>
Friday was reserved for the Vatican and the museums. The queue's were enormous, but to be honest, we were ushered to the front, and given free tickets. The place is accessible through a series of special elevators. We saw a amall selection of rooms, the archive rooms,(with various gifts to the popes down through the centuries,( and letters from people like Michaelangelo and Abraham Lincoln) the Sistine chapel, St.Peters Bascillica and Square and the papal crypt. I know it is an art lovers dream world ( apparently there were over 6 million visitors last year), but I found the whole place completely over the top and decadent in the extreme.
</br>
I thought of all the poor fools, who scrimped and saved and thought they were doing a great holy thing by sending their money in here, and this is what it was used for! In the Sistine chapel it is hard to think that one man could have created all this, painting on his back on scaffolding, constantly coming down to gain perspective. I would have thought that in here as in St.Peters Basillica, there would have been a more reverential tone, as opposed to the mouthy camera clicking tourists. Silence was expected, and adhered to, when we went down to John Paul II's crypt. It was great to see the square, and all of the vatican sites that I had seen for so long on tv. We spent the rest of the day eating ice cream and just people watching. They were making a film commercial in the square, and I had a luggage bag to buy.
</br>
It was a pity that I never got to see Rome in all its night time splendour, but I suppose thats what return visits are for. For me a week was enough, I had pushed myself and was looking forward to my own bed. I would strongly recommend Vincenzo, and his great company to anyone, it is a custom made holiday which will leave you wanting more! </p>/div>
